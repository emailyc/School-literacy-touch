<p><em>Study Title:</em>&nbsp; Self-regulated category learning</p>
<p><em>Principal Investigator:</em> Dr. Sean Kang</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how people regulate their learning of categories in a flexible learning environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Are there any benefits from participating in this study?</u></strong></p>
<p>You will not personally benefit from being in this research study. We hope to gather information about how people regulate their learning process. Your participation helps us to learn more about self-regulated study. The data obtained from your participation will be included with data from other participants as part of a scientific study that may be published in a peer-reviewed journal. These results will inform future studies of human learning.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What does this study involve?</u></strong></p>
<p>During this experiment, you will be asked to learn to categorize different objects. After the learning phase, you will be tested on your ability to classify the objects into their respective categories. You will also be asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire with questions about your race/ethnicity, age, sex, and language background.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What are the risks involved with being enrolled in this study?</u></strong></p>
<p>The risks of participating in this research are minimal. There are no known physical, psychological, legal, social or other risks associated with this study. You might find the task slightly boring.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal from this Study</strong>: Your participation is voluntary.&nbsp; You may stop participating at any time by closing the browser window or the program to withdraw from the study. Partial data will not be analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>COMPENSATION</strong>: You will be paid $2.50 for the completion of this HIT.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: This study contains a number of checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely. &nbsp;As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks, your HIT will be approved. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>: Your Mechanical Turk Worker ID will be used to distribute payment to you but will not be stored with your data. Please be aware that your MTurk Worker ID can potentially be linked to information about you on your Amazon public profile page, depending on the settings you have for your Amazon profile. &nbsp;We will not be accessing any personally identifying information about you that you may have put on your Amazon public profile page. Any reports and presentations about the findings from this study will not include your name or any other information that could identify you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each participant will be assigned a code number (not your MTurk Worker ID), and study data is labeled with the code number. All study materials will identify you only with a code. These materials will be stored in a secure lab, and data will be entered and analyzed on password-protected computers by trained members of the Cognition &amp; Education Lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raw data will be available only to Dr. Sean Kang and trained research assistants in the Cognition &amp; Education Lab. The data obtained from your participation will be included with data from other participants; no data will be reported on an individual basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information collected for this study will be used only for purposes of research. However, the Dartmouth College Office of the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects may request access to this form to ensure that procedures designed to protect research participants are being followed properly.</p>
